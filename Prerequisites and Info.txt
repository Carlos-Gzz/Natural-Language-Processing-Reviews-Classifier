You need to install the packages/modules:
Numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, re and ntlk.
Important note: In order to properly visualize the results in a graph it is important to import matplotlib.pyplot (not only matplotlib).

Anaconda install code run:

Pandas:
conda install -c anaconda pandas 

Numpy:
conda install -c anaconda numpy

Matplotlib:
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib

Nltk:
conda install -c anaconda nltk


In this example I built a model which process many written reviews and states if they are positive or negative. I also test and show the results with a test set apart from the training set.
The accuracy score in this model is above 73%.
R is awesome, but back in the days when I wanted to expand my knowledge from R to Python I took an amazing self taught Machine Learning course called 'ML A-Z'; the course tutors are Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. And as of today I keep doing different projects with the previous knowledge learned.
